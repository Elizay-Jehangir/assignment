//OUTPUT
*storing the 3 complex numbers in the list and displaying the list
(-4 + 5i ) (-3 + -3i ) (-4 + 3i )

*now delete, we assume deleting at start and displaying the list
(-3 + -3i ) (-4 + 3i ) (-7 + 2i )

*adding the first two numbers and storing in list at last 
(-3 + -3i ) (-4 + 3i ) (-7 + 2i ) (0 + 2i )

*subtracting 1 and 3 and storing in the list at last
(-3 + -3i ) (-4 + 3i ) (-7 + 2i ) (0 + 2i ) (21 + 3i )

*delete at position 4
(-3 + -3i ) (-4 + 3i ) (-7 + 2i ) (21 + 3i )

*multiplying 2 and 3 and storing in the list at last
(-3 + -3i ) (-4 + 3i ) (-7 + 2i ) (21 + 3i ) (4.42857 + -1.14286i )
  
//number of files
I have used only one file that comprises of two classes, one being 'complexa' class used as a calculator for the complex functions, and the other being a friend class 'linkedlist' that saves the complex numbers. In the structure 'node' i have made an object to class 'complexa' named 'data'. In order to store the complex and imaginary number individually, we access the real number through data.a and imaginary number through data.b
